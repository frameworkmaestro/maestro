LICENSE: This code is released under the GPL license. A copy of the file is

LAST UPDATE: 10/15/2004

OVERVIEW
This PHP script draws barcode representations of strings. It supports some
important types of barcode symbology and offers control over almost all aspects
of barcode generation.
Use it to embed barcode images in a web page or to write the image to a file.
It was written with educational purposes but it is very functional to use in
retail or warehousing applications.

FEATURES
* Height and width coding symbologies supported.
* Different barcodes types supported: Currently Code 3 of 9, Interleave 2 of 5,
  Standard 2 of 5 and Code 93.
* Different image formats supported: JPG, PNG, GIF, WBMP.
* Barcode size control: width of bars, height of bars, intercharacter gap, wide
  to narrow ratio.
* Barcode style control: inverted barcode, text label, image rotation, check
  digit.

HOW TO USE
Main files are core.php and defs.inc. Including core.php in your script should
be enough to get things going. barCode() prototype is well commented.
You also have the files test.php and wrapper.php that show you how to use it in
HTML pages.
If you know PHP and/or HTML you should figure out by yourself seamlessly.  :)

UPDATES
Newer versions of this code can be obtained by emailing me. I'll try to update
the project file at the site where you obtained it.
This notes.txt file will state any changes made to the project in HISTORY
section.

NOTES
* Bar Code specification can be found at http://www.barcodeisland.com/ &
  http://www.adams1.com/
* Since it uses GD libraries you need to have them properly installed.
  http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.image.php
  http://www.boutell.com/gd/
* You also have the limitations of GD libraries (GIF copyright, etc.) --> Patent
  is free again. GD announced GIF support again.
* WBMP file format is not working. I dont know why and I preciate if you let me
  know. ---> It is due to GD version. Get proper version.
* Get rid of all echo's in defs.inc file if I've forgotten to do so.
* Royal Mail and postnet (no capable reader) not tested but looked the same as
  web images and fonts samples.
